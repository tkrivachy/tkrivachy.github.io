title: "Neural network-based entanglement/separability in realistic scenarios"
---

Quantum entanglement is one of the most foundational concepts in quantum theory, yet it is difficult to decide whether a quantum state is entangled, even if all the information about the state is availible to us. Yet, particularly for large quantum systems, only a limited amount of information availible. We hope to tackle this situation using neural network-based techniques.
