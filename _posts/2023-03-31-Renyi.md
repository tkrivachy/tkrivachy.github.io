title: "Entanglement dimension witness from Rényi entropy-based uncertainty relations and few measurements."
---

Detecting entanglement dimension can be tedious. There exists a conceptually simple method relying on the standard quantum uncertainty relations. These relations have been shown to be outperformed by their Rényi entropy-based counterparts in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering setup. Finding and analytically proving the Rényi entropy-based entanglement criteria could allow for a stronger entanglement witness.
