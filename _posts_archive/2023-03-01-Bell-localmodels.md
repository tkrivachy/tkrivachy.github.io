title: "Which quantum states have correlations that are inexplicable with classical models?"
---

In the setup proposed by Bell, two parties who share quantum entanglement can have such strong correlations that no classical ('locally causal') explanation exists. However, not all quantum states can produce such strong correlations. In fact, it was shown that many quantum states have classical models, which can explain any correlation generated by them in the standard Bell scenario,Â i.e. they are replaceable in the Bell scenario. In this project we would investigate the existence of such classical explanations by asking an artificial neural network to learn the best possible classical model. Such numerics have the promise of overcoming previous conceptual and numerical obstacles, and can have implications for several aspects of Bell nonlocality.
