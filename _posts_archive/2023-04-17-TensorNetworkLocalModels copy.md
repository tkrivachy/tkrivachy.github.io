title: "Connecting tensor network generative models with Bell nonlocality in networks"
---

Several interesting, yet complex Bell nonlocality examples in networks share striking similarities with some tensor network models, a model used to represent large quantum states. The goal of this project is to connect the two concepts, both theoretically and numerically.
