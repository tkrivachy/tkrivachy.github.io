title: "High-dimensional entanglement for robust non-local correlations in a triangle network / Noise robust non-local correlations in a triangle network."
---
In the setup proposed by Bell, two parties who share quantum entanglement can have such strong correlations that no classical ('locally causal') explanation exists. The recent generalization to more parties on networks brings foundationally interesting new aspects, however lacks an experimentally feasible proposal due to low noise tolerance. In this project we would harness the power of high-dimensional entanglement to overcome these difficulties.
