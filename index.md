I am fascinated by quantum information, machine learning, networks and primarily, the interface of these three. I'm particularly interested in using neural networks for understanding quantum phenomena on networks better.

In my free time, I enjoy finding exploits in (quantum or classical) cryptographic protocols and bugs that exploit them (white hat of course).

Currently, I work as an SNSF Postdoc.Mobility fellow in Antonio Ac√≠n's group ([QIT group](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/)) at ICFO, Castelldefels (Barcelona).
