I am fascinated by quantum information, machine learning, networks and primarily, the interface of these three. I'm particularly interested in using neural networks for understanding quantum phenomena on networks better.

Currently, I work as an SNSF Postdoc.Mobility fellow in Antonio Ac√≠n's group ([QIT group](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/)) at ICFO, Castelldefels (Barcelona).
