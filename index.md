I am fascinated by quantum information, machine learning, networks and primarily, the interface of these three. I'm particularly interested in using neural networks for understanding quantum phenomena on networks better.

Currently, I work as a postdoc in Marcus Huber's group at Atominstitut, TU Wien.
From July 2023 I will be moving on as a Postdoc.Mobility fellow to ICFO, Barcelona.
